<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


### Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To install this on your personal machine follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

1. Go to the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) page.
2. Follow the instructions there to install the latest version of homebrew on to your mac.

### Installation
 
1. After installing homebrew paste this into your terminal
```sh
brew tap EthanHolen/taps
```
2. Then install the software by pasting
```sh
brew install rdme-gen
```



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The first time you run `rdme-gen` you will be prompted to clone the default templates into your home directory, the file will be called `~/.readmeTemplates/`

> Feel free to edit the README files in this directory as they will be the ones copied when running the rdme-gen comand (be careful though, changing the file structure or names of files will cause the program to fail)

When `rdme-gen` is run with no flags the default README template is copied into the current directory.

### Flags

| Flag	 Name| Usage | Example |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `-f` | Prompts the user with questions such as github username and project name which will be populated into the readme. | `rdme-gen -f` |
| `-img` | Brings in a `rdme-images` folder and adds image links to the template. | `rdme-gen -img` |
| `-p` | Allows the user to add a custom path as the target instead of the current directory. | `rdme-gen -p ~/projects/my-new-amazing-project/` |
